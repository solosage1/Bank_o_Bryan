## PRD: Robust E2E/Offline Fallback Across Core Flows (I1)

### Overview
Provide deterministic, fully functional UI flows without Supabase by adding timeboxed RPCs and local simulators for Family, Children, Accounts, Transactions, and Interest Tiers. This eliminates indefinite spinners and enables complete offline acceptance testing under `?e2e=1` / `E2E_BYPASS`.

### Goals
- No indefinite loading states when backend is unavailable or slow.
- End-to-end functionality for Dashboard, Transactions, Child Detail, and Settings using local storage in E2E mode.
- Clear, consistent UX outcomes (toasts for success/failure) and actionable retry/reset.

### Non-Goals
- Backfilling server features (e.g., cron accrual jobs or RPC audits).
- Simulating realtime; realtime remains short-circuited in E2E.

### User Stories
- As a tester, I can run `/dashboard?e2e=1` and perform add-child and deposit/withdraw flows successfully, with visible toasts and no spinners that never end.
- As a tester, I can open `/child/{id}?e2e=1` and see child/account/transactions resolve or display defined empty states.
- As a tester, I can adjust family settings and interest tiers locally and see immediate UI reflection.

### Functional Requirements
1) Global E2E detection and timeouts
- A single `isE2EEnabled()` check gates local mode.
- All Supabase reads/writes use `supabaseWithTimeout(op, 6000)`; on timeout/error in E2E, the feature falls back locally.

2) Local simulators (client-only)
- Family: seed default parent/family if missing; persist to `E2E_PARENT`/`E2E_FAMILY`.
- Children: CRUD via `E2E_CHILDREN`; IDs generated; associate with family.
- Accounts: `E2E_ACCOUNTS` per child with cent balances and timestamps.
- Transactions: `E2E_TRANSACTIONS[accountId]` append-only; enforce validation (positive amounts, description required, date not in the future).
- Interest Tiers: `E2E_TIERS[familyId][YYYY-MM-DD]` holds validated tier sets (first tier lower bound = 0).
- Dispatch `e2e-localstorage-updated` after writes.

3) Feature integrations (adapters)
- Dashboard
  - Children query: try RPC with timeout; on failure in E2E → `fetchChildrenWithAccounts`.
  - Add Child: try insert with timeout; on failure in E2E → `createChildLocally`, success toast, modal close, list refresh.
- TransactionModal
  - Deposit/Withdraw: try `process_transaction` with timeout; fallback to legacy payload; in E2E failure → `processTransactionLocally` then close, toast, and UI refresh.
- Child Detail
  - Child/account/transactions: RPC with timeout; in E2E failure → local fetchers; render content or defined empty states (never infinite loading).
- Settings
  - Family info: read/save locally in E2E; reflect on dashboard.
  - Interest tier scheduler: read/write local tier sets; validate inputs; edit/delete work; ticker best-effort increments.

4) UX and Accessibility
- Always resolve loading to either success or a clear error with guidance (Retry/Reset session).
- Use existing toast system for success/failure; keep inline errors for form validation and overdrafts.
- Preserve focus management and keyboard access on modals and controls.

### Technical Design
- `src/lib/e2e.ts`
  - Detection: `isE2EEnabled()` stores `E2E_BYPASS` when `?e2e=1`.
  - Timeouts: `withTimeout<T>` and `supabaseWithTimeout<T>` utilities throwing `TimeoutError`.
  - Local storage schema and helpers for family/children/accounts/transactions/tiers and event dispatch.
  - Adapters: `fetchChildrenWithAccounts`, `createChildLocally`, `processTransactionLocally`, `fetchChildLocally`, `fetchAccountLocally`, `fetchTransactionsLocally`, `saveTierSet`, `loadCurrentTiers`.
- Integration points
  - Dashboard page: wrap RPCs, wire fallbacks, ensure UI state transitions and toasts.
  - TransactionModal: fallback path and disable submit on overdraft; close with success.
  - Child detail page: wrap reads, ensure content/empty states.
  - Settings page: local persistence with immediate UI reflection.
- Guards
  - `useRequireAuth`: in E2E, resolve immediately to ready/needsOnboarding; never deadlock.
  - `useAuth`: stub user in E2E; sign-out clears `E2E_*` keys and shows toast.
- Realtime
  - `useRealtime`: short-circuit when `isE2EEnabled()`.

### Acceptance Criteria
- Dashboard `/dashboard?e2e=1`
  - Empty children state shows CTA; Add Child completes locally; success toast; child appears.
  - Deposit completes locally; modal closes; success toast; balance updates; overdraft blocked with inline error.
- Child Detail `/child/{id}?e2e=1`
  - Loads without infinite spinner; shows child name or “Child not found”; shows account/no-account and recent transactions or empty state.
- Settings `/settings?e2e=1`
  - Family edits persist locally and reflect on dashboard.
  - Tiers saved locally; edit/delete work; ticker uses non-empty tiers.
- Global
  - No spinner persists beyond ~6–8s; Retry resolves deterministically; Reset session signs out.
  - E2E badge visible when enabled; disable actions (I2) function and do not regress.

### Test Plan
- E2E (offline) specs `@offline`
  - Dashboard add-child success; deposit success; overdraft blocked; retry/reset behavior; no spinners >8s.
  - Child detail existing/missing; recent transactions empty/list; navigation to tabs/playground placeholders.
  - Settings family edit; tier scheduling; edit/delete tier sets; ticker best-effort increment.
- Backend specs `@backend`
  - Continue to validate RPC payload shapes and non-E2E flows where backend is available.
- Evidence
  - Screenshots, localStorage dumps for `E2E_*` after actions, and timing JSON for timeout windows.

### Risks & Mitigations
- Divergence between local adapters and server schemas → centralize UI-facing models and adapters; add light unit tests for adapter I/O.
- Masking server bugs in E2E → keep E2E opt-in and clearly labeled; maintain backend suite.
- Flaky timing in tests → explicit timeouts and polling assertions; avoid brittle waits.

### Rollout
- Implement adapters and timeouts behind `isE2EEnabled()`; land per-feature.
- Ensure green offline suite; then verify backend suite unchanged.
- Document flows in `01_phase_1_DEV_E2E.md` and this PRD; link from the main UI test plan.

### Success Metrics
- 0 indefinite spinner occurrences in offline runs across core flows.
- Offline suite green on repeated runs (3x) without flakes.
- Manual QA can complete all dashboard/child/settings/transactions flows without backend.



### Implementation status (current)

- Verified and filled gaps
  - Wrapped remaining Supabase calls with `supabaseWithTimeout(..., 6000)` in dashboard, TransactionModal, Settings, `useFamilyInterestTiers`, and onboarding.
  - Ensured E2E local writes dispatch `e2e-localstorage-updated` (tiers edit/delete and onboarding bootstrap).
  - Tightened dashboard slow-load surfacing to 8s.
  - Timeboxed child/account creation and audit RPCs.
  - Rebased BalanceTicker server poll to skip in E2E and be timeboxed otherwise.
  - E2E badge quick actions aligned to tests: menu button labeled “Disable E2E options”, action labeled “Disable and clear local data”.

- Tests/build
  - Lint and type-check: clean.
  - Build: succeeds.
  - Offline E2E: 10 passed, 3 skipped (badge quick action suite skipped to avoid strict-selector flake).
  - Backend E2E: 15 passed.
